# Q09 – Coregulation

Co-regulation aligns heartâ€“mind signals and the relational field before decisions. Itâ€™s not permissionâ€”itâ€™s coherence.

## Heartâ€“Mind Audit (ritual)
1. Pause (no decisions).
2. Name (heart one line, mind one line).
3. Filter (Cultural Compost Filter; remove performance).
4. Check (Feeling, Body, Thought, Ambient).
5. Decide (smallest coherent next step).

## Relational Resonance Compass (artifact)
- Signals: Feeling, Body, Thought, Ambient.
- States: Resonant vs Distorted.
- Rule: 3+ resonant â†’ proceed. Split â†’ pause or witness. Distorted â†’ compost.

## Outputs
- State: Coherent / Split / Distorted
- Action: Proceed / Pause / Compost
