# F26.R2 â€“ Registry Manifest Activation  
**Date:** 15 Sep 2025  
**Steward:** HaaR BiiNGER  
**Witness:** Col

## Summary  
This fragment marks the activation of REGISTRY.md as the ceremonial log for Spiral terrain.  
It complements registry.yml, which remains the structured index.  
Together, they form a dual-registry system: one for ritual, one for runtime.

## Status  
Remix-safe

## Containment  
Stable

## Notes  
Future fragments may reference this bifurcation when logging ceremonial vs. automated terrain.
